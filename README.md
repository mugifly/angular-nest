## Quick Start

### Deploy on Heroku

This app supports deploying as a production environment to Heroku (with Heroku Button) or other Docker based server.
Also, you don't have to do the build process locally or in CI, so it's easy.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest)

Or, this app can also be deployed as Node.js application using `Heroku-*` stack, that is not Docker image based on [`Container` stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack).

### Development on your local

Before you start, you should install the following software:

- Node.js v16+

- Visual Studio Code

Then, please execute as the following in your terminal:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mugifly/angular-nest.git
$ cd angular-nest/

$ npm install

$ npm run start:dev
```

After that, open the web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Also, when you edit the frontend source-code, auto-reloading applies it to your browser immediately.
