## Quick Start

### Deployment on Heroku

This app supports deploying as a production environment to Heroku.
Also you don't have to do the build process locally or in CI, so it's easy.

Try it now from the Heroku Button:<br>
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Or, this app can also be deployed to Container stack on Heroku, as Docker based application.

Please see [Deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest/wiki/Deploy-to-Heroku) page on the wiki to learn more.

### Development on Local

Before you start, you should install the following software:

- Git

- Node.js v16+

Next, please [fork this repository](https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest/fork).

Then, execute as the following in your terminal:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/angular-nest.git
