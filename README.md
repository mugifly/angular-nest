## Quick Start

This app supports direct deployment to [various hosting services](https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest/wiki/#Deployments) as a production environment.

It's also very easy to automatic-deployment, because you don't have to run the build process locally or in CI.

### Deployment on Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This app can be deployed either to the `Heroku` stack (Node.js buildpack based) or the `Container` stack (Docker based).

Please see [Deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest/wiki/Deploy-to-Heroku) page for more informations.

### Deployment on Render

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

This app can be deployed either as a Node.js application or Docker based application.

Please see [Deploy to Render](https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest/wiki/Deploy-to-Render) page for more informations.

### Deployment on other servers (with/without Docker)

### Development on Local

Before you start, you should install the following software:

- Git

- Node.js v16+

- Visual Studio Code

Next, please [fork this repository](https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest/fork).

Then, execute as the following in your terminal:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/angular-nest.git
$ cd angular-nest/

$ npm install

$ npm run start:dev
```

Finally, open the web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
Also, when you edit the frontend source-code, auto-reloading applies your changes to the browser immediately.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest/wiki/) for more information.
