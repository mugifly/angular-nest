## Quick Start for Development

### StackBlitz

StackBlitz lets you quickly run and edit your source code in your browser.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/mugifly/angular-nest)

### Local

Before you start, you should install the following softwares:

- Git

- Node.js v16+

- Visual Studio Code

Next, please [Create a new repository from this repository](https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest/generate).

Then, execute as the following in your terminal:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/angular-nest.git
$ cd angular-nest/

$ npm install

$ npm run start:dev
```

Finally, open the web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
Also, when you edit the frontend source-code, auto-reloading applies your changes to the browser immediately.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/mugifly/angular-nest/wiki/) for additional information.
You'll find tips for implementing database connectivity, guides for future updates, and more.
